> Sobriety tracking app to assist users with any addiction

## Project outline
Soberize is a sobriety tracking app. Users have the ability to create accounts, track days that they have stayed sober (doesn't have to be a "substance"), and get digital rewards for sober streaks. After creating an account, users will have their own dashboard with a calendar showing their sober streak, list of their recieved rewards, and forms to update the calendar. This web app is a concept so it requires the user to cooperate 100% to work (and theres no promise from me that it will work with everyone).
